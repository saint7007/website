<h1>Welcome to my website! ‚≠êÔ∏è</h1>
<p> How was your day? Don't go further to read the below passage, give it a shot to think how was your day.
 People who truly know me, call me Khushman incase you don't call me Sushant.
 Khushman is an consultant for problems which requires deep STEM research as solution.
 Khushman's ultimate achievable goal is to enable nations to create real value in deep science and deep tech and yet no negative impact to Mother Nature. üéâ
 His favourite past time to teach people how to play game theory and win at life and not vs each other.  üéâ</p>

 <p> Let me give you preface, whom Khushman gives his service </p>
      
 <p> Story 1 - The other day towards evening end, hopefully tired of work, Engineer named Vikram reaches Khushman over phone, praisingly he says, "I am earning good but still not happy.
    Other guys earning less are really rocking at life. What to do ?
  Khushman told him following, there can be multiple reason he might be unhappy, <br>
  a. His family condition, he had 3 sisters and retired father and recently married <br>
  b. His body condition, issue with release of serotonin, the hormone of happiness. <br>
  c. His mind condition, issue of who m I (Identity & purpose) <br>
  <p> Khushman knew about average Indian software engineer salary, Vaibhav could not afford a consultant, Khushman advised him to bring 30 folks who are at this similar stage of life.
     After a week, Vaibhav comes back with 1 friend from his native region, saying he doesn't have these much friends.
     I said but every friend has another friend right ? Vaibhav had no answer, there was awkwardness in the air, 
     very quickly Khushman changed topic towards Vaibhav's physical well being and hanged the phone.
      
  <p> You know the problem was, Vaibhav and his friend Keshav were unable to bear the truth that multiple folks will also get happy. </p>
  <p> And my request for bringing 30 people facing similar issue, made him realize the fact, that there are 30 others in unhappy state as he is. So he is okay with his unhappy state. </p>
      
  <p> So please if you don't have thirty people in your contact with same issue as yours, DO NOT CONTACT ME. </p>     

 </p>
 <p> Story 2 - The other day a e-commerce startup founder came to me he says, I have revenue/series of funding/customer base but he is struggling with perishable goods  </p>
 <p> I told him let's pick one perishable item, say tomatoes, he said not tomatoes our company has started making tomato sauces from them as they get older and mushy.
 <p> Lets talk about lettuce, well for that I said lettuce that grows in less magnesium rich soil will last longer. I got paid for that.
 <p> He just went on to apply this magnesium mineral logic in all his products. And he did not consult me for other items as he could not afford me. Eventually rised other problems.
 <p> So if you have series of funding more than 5 million USD. YOU CAN CONTACT ME.</p>
    
  <p>Story 3 - The other day genetics startup founder came to me and says, he is trying to decrease genome sequencing time, it's eating large chunk of money in servers leaving less for actual research.</p>
  <p> He asked me help with software to reduce time, I adviced him to do multithreading and read documents of the software he is using.</p>
  <p> Truly speaking, it's the problem that started with scientist who invented the logic of this base pair, he created multiple photocopies of base pairs. To know what is 1 base pair.</p>
  <p> How doomed are we, we trust old scientist and not question them. </p>
  <p>I say stop using multiple pictures of base pair just to get one, why not use more sensitive photons films for imaging and reduce these images of base pairs.</p>
  <p> This becomes photonics engineering problem </p>
  <p> So if you have series of funding less than 5 million USD but you working in deep STEM. YOU CAN CONTACT ME.</p>
  
  <p>What I do when not working, is apply data structures and algorithms with mathematics to predict the future of a sales based on data.</p>
  <p> For example, applying derivates, integration and probability concepts with data science at precision. </p>
      
   <p> Now why I have made this money rule, either people are after profits or trying to get out of poverty.
      What I see is how much you are ready to lose to solve the problem. That determines your grit and thereby your fate.</p>
  
 <p>Now that you know me, based on your self evaluation, reach me at my email, khushman@trutheory.org  üéâ</p> 

 <p>For people with story 1, if you can't afford me, make friends and contribute and reach me at my email, khushman@trutheory.org üéâ</p>
