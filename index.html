<h1>Welcome to my website! ⭐️</h1>
 <p>How was your day? 🎉</p>
 <p>My name is Sushant Sawant but people who truly know me, call me Khushman. 🎉</p>
 <p>I am an consultant for deep, science and technology. 🎉</p>
 <p>My aim is to enable nations to create real value in deep science and deep tech and yet no negative impact to Mother Nature. 🎉</p>
 <p>My favourite past time to teach people how to play game theory and win at life and not vs each other.  🎉</p>

 <p> Let me give you preface, whom I give my service </p>
      
 <p> Story 1 - The other day a senior software engineer came to me he says, he is earning good but he is still not happy. What to do ? </p>
  <p>  I told him following, there can be multiple reason he might be unhappy,</p>
  <p>  1. His family condition, he had 3 sisters and retired father and recently married</p>
  <p>  2. His body condition, issue with release of serotonin, the hormone of happiness </p>
  <p>  3. His mind condition, issue of who m I (Identity & purpose)</p>
  <p> As he could not afford me, I told him bring 30 folks with similar stages of life. But he came back with 1 friends from his native region, saying he doesn't have these much friends.
     I said but your friend has friend right ? </p>
      
  <p> You know the problem was, they were unable to bear the truth that multiple folks will also get happy. </p>
  <p> And my request for bringing 30 people facing similar issue, made him realize the fact, that there are 30 others in unhappy state as he is. So he is okay with his unhappy state. </p>
      
  <p> So please if you don't have thirty people in your contact with same issue as yours, DO NOT CONTACT ME. </p>     


 <p> Story 2 - The other day a e-commerce startup founder came to me he says, I have revenue/series of funding/customer base but he is struggling to sell perishable goods  </p>
 <p> I told him let's pick one perishable item, say tomatoes, he said not tomatoes our company has started making tomato sauces from them as they get older and mushy.
 <p> Lets talk about lettuce, well lettuce that grows in less magnesium rich soil will last longer. I got paid for that.
 <p> He just went on to apply this magnesium mineral logic in all his products. And he did not consult me for other items as he could not afford me. Eventually rised other problems.
 <p> So if you have series of funding more than 5 million USD. YOU CAN CONTACT ME.</p>
    
  <p>Story 3 - The other day genetics startup founder came to me and says, he is trying to decrease genome sequencing time, it's eating large chunk of money in servers leaving less for actual research.</p>
  <p> He asked me help with software to reduce time, I adviced him to do multithreading and read documents of the software he is using.</p>
  <p> Truly speaking, it's the problem that started with scientist who invented the logic of this base pair, he created multiple photocopies of base pairs. To know what is 1 base pair.</p>
  <p> How doomed are we, we trust old scientist and not question them. </p>
  <p>I say stop using multiple pictures of base pair just to get one, why not use more sensitive photons films for imaging and reduce these images of base pairs.</p>
  <p> This becomes photonics engineering problem </p>
  
 <p>Now that you know me if you can afford me or not reach me at my email, khushman@trutheory.org  🎉</p> 

 <p>If you can't afford me make friends and contribute and reach me at my email, khushman@trutheory.org 🎉</p>
