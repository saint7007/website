<h1>Welcome to my website! ⭐️</h1>
 <p>How was your day? 🎉</p>
 <p>My name is Sushant Sawant but people who truly know me, call me Khushman Sawant. 🎉</p>
 <p>I am an consultant for deep, science and technology. 🎉</p>
 <p>My aim is to enable nations to create real value in deep science and deep tech and yet no negative impact to Mother Nature. 🎉</p>
 <p>My favourite past time to teach people how to play game theory and win at life and not vs each other.  🎉</p>

 <p> Let me give you preface, whom I give my service </p>
      
 <p> Story 1- The other day a senior software engineer came to me he says, he is earning good but he is still not happy. What to do ? </p>
  <p>  I told him following, there can be multiple reason he might be unhappy,</p>
  <p>  1. His family condition, he had 3 sisters and retired father and recently married</p>
  <p>  2. His body condition, issue with release of serotonin, the hormone of happiness </p>
  <p>  3. His mind condition, issue of who m I (Identity & purpose)</p>
  <p> As he could not afford me, I told him bring 30 folks with similar stages of life. But he came back with 1 friends from his native region, saying he doesn't have these much friends.
     I said but your friend has friend right ? I said m sorry, my time on earth is precious too. </p>
      
  <p> You know the problem was, they were unable to bear the truth that multiple folks will also get happy. </p>
  <p> And my questions made him focus on the fact, that there are 30 others in unhappy state as he is. So he is okay with his unhappy state. </p>
      
  <p> So please if you don't have thirty people in your contact with same issue as yours, DO NOT CONTACT ME. </p>     


 <p> Story 2- The other day a e-commerce startup founder came to me he says, I have large revenue/series of funding/customer base but he is struggling to sell perishable goods  </p>
      <p> I told him let's pick one perishable item, say tomatoes, he said not tomatoes our company has started making tomatoes from them as they get older and mushy.
         <p> Lets talk about lettuce
